I love camellias. This post is going to be my first post about gardening. There are many qualities
that I really like about camellias. READMORE They produce profuse blooms of large and beautiful
flowers during cold, gloomy seasons when few other plants are in bloom. The foliage is attractive,
glossy and can be used to make tea. (*Camellia sinensis* is the species commercially grown to
produce tea leaves.) They are evergreen and remain lush in winter, when anything else would likely
be a conifer. They do not demand full sun and are content to be containerized on a condo balcony.
Last but not the least, many cultivars will stand short periods of freezing temperatures as low as
−15 °C, and there are cold hardier ones that can tolerate temperatures as low as −25 °C.

Therefore, during the past 10 months or so, I have been trying to get my hands onto camellias. Since
camellias are not reliably hardy in the GTA area, no nurseries I am aware of grow them here, and
they are really hard to find. I went as far as ordering seeds online, before realizing that camellia
seeds are not true to parent and the dried out ones, commonly sold online, are not viable.

Places I found that carry them either order from BC or the States. Unfortunately, no BC nurseries I
know of offer retail mail order or only offer it for C. Sinensis, and US nurseries cannot ship
retail orders to Canada. (I tried Nuccio’s Nurseries in California and Camellia Forest Nursery in
North Carolina.) For this post, I would like to share the places that I have found that do carry
camellias in or near the GTA area. Note that these places do not carry camellias year-round and only
receive shipments at specific times in a year.

* [Sheridan Nurseries](http://www.sheridannurseries.com/): I found my first camellia from Sheridan
  in February. They carried a very small number of them in the Mississauga locations. The cultivars
  that were available were Mathotiana, Laura Walker, Kramer’s Supreme, Kanjiro and Stephanie Golden.
  Note that these are not the cold hardy (Zone 6) cultivars.
* [Humber Nurseries](https://www.gardencentre.com/): I found my second camellia from this place in
  March. They also only carry a small number of them. The cultivars that were available were Jury’s
  Yellow, April Blush and Kramer’s Supreme. April Blush is the only cold hardy (Zone 6B) cultivar
  developed by Dr. Clifford Parks.
* [Kim’s Nature](http://kimsnature.ca/): This is the place known to carry many oriental plant
  species. Camellias are not exception. In July, they carried about 30 camellias. [More details are
  here](https://www.facebook.com/648959355176314/photos/a.648963351842581.1073741827.648959355176314/1148928105179434/?type=3).
  I bought 5 plants from them. None of the cultivars offered were cold hardy to Zone 6.

Below are two places I have spoken to that do carry camellias in spring. Because I missed their
shipments of the year, I have not bought plants from them:

* [Rice Road Greenhouses and Garden Centre](http://www.millionplants.com/): This place is in
  Welland, ON and receive camellias from BC at around March.
* [South Coast Gardens](http://southcoastgardens.ca/): This place is in St. Williams, ON, opens in
  early May of the year and seems to be the only one that carries many cold hardy cultivars. The
  owner, Kevin Kavanagh, whom I spoke to briefly on the phone, appeared to have a lot of experience
  growing cold hardy camellias outdoors here in the region.

In the coming winter, I am going to follow up with more posts about how I am going to try to
overwinter my camellias (mostly Zone 7 cultivars) outdoor with lots of protections here in Toronto.
Stay tuned and wish me luck.
